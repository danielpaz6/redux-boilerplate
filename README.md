This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

This is a boilerplate to use React + Redux toolkit + Material UI ( with my own design ).<br>
This example can be a start point by taking the [Redux's example](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-2-app-structure) ( the names were taken from there too )
